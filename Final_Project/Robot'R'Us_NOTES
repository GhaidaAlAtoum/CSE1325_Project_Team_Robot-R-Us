Notes :
        1- We are able to create Robot Models and printing the catalog of Models in CLI , and we've done the GUI for the adding and printing 
   		but we're facing some trouble with the makefile that combines the GUI files with the shop CLI files. We are working to resolve this issue.
		We hope that you would take that into consideration
        2- The repository has the Classes files and a make file that compiles the Main.cpp
	        with the command make all
	3- The controller class is where our work on the GUI is.
 
        4- To open the class diagram or the Use case diagram :
	     Either:
		 1. Open www.draw.io
		 2. open using Github
		 3. from our repository choose the corresponding graph
		 OR:
		 download the content of the repository then click on the Class_Diagram.xml
		 and it will open using the default browser.
	5- The class diagram is still under continous editing as we work on it every day.
