Notes :
     1- The repository has the Classes files and a make file that compiles the Main.cpp
	        with the command make all
	 2- The controller class is where our work on the GUI is.
	 3- Our team is working in a different logical order from the provided sprint 
	    we are trying to finish the respective GUI of each member of the shop (PM,PHB,SA,customer)
		We hope that you would take that into consideration
	 4- To open the class diagram or the Use case diagram :
	     Either:
		 1. Open www.draw.io
		 2. open using Github
		 3. from our repository choose the corresponding graph
		 OR:
		 download the content of the repository then click on the Class_Diagram.xml
		 and it will open using the default browser.
	5- The class diagram is still under continous editing as we work on it every day.
